Unknown 0:01
No, I agree.

Unknown 0:04
And I will ask you some questions so for

Unknown 0:09
about 30 seconds.

Unknown 0:14
Oh, I must have studied psycho biology and UCLA.

Unknown 0:20
I'm from Hong Kong.

Unknown 0:23
I'm not. So, like, where do you usually use

Unknown 0:28
my life, using social media.

Unknown 0:35
Yeah, I think most probably would be using for social media apps like Instagram, Facebook, Whatsapp

Unknown 0:45
emails to sometimes. Probably Google something when I honestly, yeah.

Unknown 0:53
He likes to texting are you liking you like.

Unknown 0:55
I like texting more than Pauline's.

Unknown 1:01
And you text very often.

Unknown 1:07
Okay so normally what people what people are looking for me then. Yeah.

Unknown 1:18
Now, let's talk about the app. Okay.

Unknown 1:29
So I will use the app.

Unknown 1:33
Can you find in worse.

Unknown 1:37
How can you pick the topic in the app play where you want to find something's supposed a fee.

Unknown 1:47
So I noticed

Unknown 1:47
that on

Unknown 1:49
speed, I could go to the right upper corner, and I could pick a topic that I'm interested in. So I think that's how we do it.

Unknown 2:00
Dude, have it be called Time To Live. Finally, Once you open the app.

Unknown 2:06
Not really. I'm used to like having to like three strikes as like a menu thing, so I could, I could probably find it.

Unknown 2:15
Because there are some people tell me like when they open the app. Yeah, they feel really come to us for the first stage, because they cannot really find out what's going on, what does this mean. Oh yeah,

Unknown 2:31
I guess. At first, it does sound weird. For that, I don't know, there isn't like a lot of buttons here that I could like click on to and like maybe to another page so. So it's not that bad, I think. Yeah.

Unknown 2:48
And it was.

Unknown 3:02
Can you tell me who is the person in charge of the community.

Unknown 3:09
over friendship. I mean the person.

Unknown 3:14
Yeah.

Unknown 3:24
I don't know to be honest.

Unknown 3:29
I tried like options and about us.

Unknown 3:33
But I don't see it.

Unknown 3:38
I noticed that

Unknown 3:41
I could like email them to like high end fine

Unknown 3:45
sisterhood dukkha

Unknown 3:47
yeah I don't know who that is.

Unknown 3:57
Wait, you mean.

Unknown 3:59
Oh, I think I misunderstood your question.

Unknown 4:03
I thought you were asking like who is in charge of like this app.

Unknown 4:09
It is

Unknown 4:10
they're in charge of the apps. I certainly can see that the lady photo of a lady. And once you clean the photo. The will show you Oh, this person. Usually these person were in charge of this comment in there, she were these people posts.

Unknown 4:30
But she's in charge of this space.

Unknown 4:34
She's gonna

Unknown 4:35
she opened this page or she's like a part of this.

Unknown 4:38
She opened his page. Talk about this. I could

Unknown 4:41
do that too. Right. I could be in charge of a page.

Unknown 4:45
Can I know I don't think you can because they have like this company has to slide, see me.

Unknown 4:53
I say

Unknown 4:58
so.

Unknown 5:01
So you cannot really find the right.

Unknown 5:04
I don't have these.

Unknown 5:14
I think that's the bigger.

Unknown 5:17
See, I don't have these buttons here.

Unknown 5:25
Enjoy it and maybe.

Unknown 5:30
Let's talk about it.

Unknown 5:32
Okay, can you

Unknown 5:35
like the heart.

Unknown 5:37
like, unlike the heart. Let me try.

Unknown 5:46
This is so weird.

Unknown 5:59
Like the heart, you don't want to give more hearts.

Unknown 6:07
Okay. Oh my God, I hate this out. Okay.

Unknown 6:13
Now, do you realize I this come in as my hundred why I can

Unknown 6:20
like keep pressing

Unknown 6:21
Yeah, this is so fake. So, once you keep pressing and once you have a number Yeah, you will be on the top of the page. So people will see your calmly mentally once they open the

Unknown 6:34
phones and I like you

Unknown 6:36
know actually, you don't need one thing, if you read in one. I

Unknown 6:40
can like get hard to myself. Okay,

Unknown 6:44
so if you do not laugh. And you don't, you didn't get a lot of, lot of light in your comment Yeah. Your, your post will be in the back of the people will not really see

Unknown 6:57
that I can give myself a lot of likes and it'll go out. Okay, I see understand how it works. Now,

Unknown 7:06
I don't like this, how much.

Unknown 7:09
So, do you realize, actually this this kind of style is somebody similar.

Unknown 7:20
Yeah, with other pictures is. Seems like

Unknown 7:26
a better, like why do you Why do you think you server is a better.

Unknown 7:30
And if I you did like four days.

Unknown 7:34
And this Instagram like if you like two persons,

Unknown 7:38
like accidentally, you can unlike it.

Unknown 7:41
And you couldn't like come show like your photo. She doesn't talk.

Unknown 7:49
Like if I, if I want this, my post to go out. I could just like keep on liking it which is like not very objective, but on Instagram, you can't do that. So, I think. Instagram is more fun.

Unknown 8:08
It's just better it's better organized.

Unknown 8:12
It's less manipulation of the user so that it's like a fair game.

Unknown 8:24
And do you like the

Unknown 8:30
dancing here. Sorry. Do they like it show it show topics come next to you. Your lifestyles.

Unknown 8:43
Most of them I say, most of them are like pretty related to girls are using like too much for you to talk too much.

Unknown 8:54
I think they're good. I think the topics aren't surprise.

Unknown 9:09
Lucky.

Unknown 9:13
Mama.

Unknown 9:15
But what about this

Unknown 9:19
portly.

Unknown 9:20
And

Unknown 9:21
so, so in this in this page, you can see like different people. Yeah, who are using timeline, maybe attention. Yeah, I see that earlier, or you're using my useful,

Unknown 9:37
I it's not very useful I thought like these people as they are, they are like yeah, are there like people who was posting. Yeah, people are posting yeah but not the organizer off the page. So

Unknown 9:53
you saw the same disease of the user will post a story, yes isolines Abby's like they don't know who is our user when you post something.

Unknown 10:03
Okay. Anonymous.

Unknown 10:06
I see.

Unknown 10:21
So, serasa Have you used the Most High, which which have you mostly use the most.

Unknown 10:32
Okay, pick two. Yeah, Instagram and WhatsApp

Unknown 10:36
Instagram was. Yeah. Okay, so, so you you you like to use my wife. I

Unknown 10:44
mean that that's how I connect with her like friends and family.

Unknown 10:48
Yeah, okay. So you prefer the satellite isn't a mama and Mama. Oh, my woman social

Unknown 10:58
media, I regulate I would just like I think this app is more like if I have a question that's related to like female and I don't know where I could ask. I probably would have liked I post something anonymously like if it's too embarrassed to ask my friends or like anyone else.

Unknown 11:17
Yeah, so up. If I can remain that you will prefer

Unknown 11:24
shella user on know.

Unknown 11:31
Or maybe the user could choose when to show their mobile their identity or not, like, sometimes maybe if I meet friends on this app, then I could like

Unknown 11:42
inbox them, and like talk to them and stuff like that like Instagram you know direct message. And that's where I expose who I am, but then when I want to post questions that is too hard to answer, or like to embarrassed to ask that I probably want to stay anonymous.

Unknown 11:58
Okay. And really me the videos Oh saying, No, in a big when you enroll an issue. Be, make sure like you, if you are female or nine.

Unknown 12:14
Yeah I think so I think it tells you the privacy.

Unknown 12:18
Cuz you just saw that comment which is like a,

Unknown 12:21
it's a guys like it's, yeah I think I just saw a comment saying that. That implies that he's a guy. And then I feel not so comfortable to talk about in a place like that. If I want to like ask him, like

Unknown 12:35
girls issue. Yeah. Okay.

Unknown 12:46
So I want

Unknown 12:49
you to have a chance to, like. Want me to mega app or something like that which is woman social media. Now, so, what kind of decide where you prefer like you said you just say you want me to be anonymous. Like, you will naturally user. And now, so you will not also show the picture of a female. Yeah, sure. You can texting with other people.

Unknown 13:21
Yeah, you can text with other people with your profile but then when you post you could choose not to expose yourself. Yeah, but I feel like you know like when girls are like in a group, there probably will be like a lot of gossip and stuff. And then, like maybe others will comment badly on some someone's post like if I say oh I have like a trauma, and then this girl will be like very mean and say, Oh, you deserve it. So I don't know like hey yeah i think that the app needs a little bit more management so

Unknown 13:56
you shoot you how you how this and have like AI something like that I can make sure there's not any comment we're.

Unknown 14:05
The this pose, something like that.

Unknown 14:10
But then it will be like too much control too. I'm not sure about that, like having a

Unknown 14:16
little moments have is kinda like, like a woman have a connection. Yeah, so he was a nice engender. Yeah. So, just like Hussein, in the ABS show, even the hose in there so Come on, show monkey in the bottom of your post sale i O, your poetess might have something really nasty. And you will feel really bad. Especially if you just,

Unknown 14:45
I just had a trauma and then I was like to say how sad I am, and then this person who would like comment something bad. They feel like even worse. I might even like have a bad negative thoughts about this so it's probably not a good thing. Yeah, so maybe an AI would work. Control

Unknown 15:03
to control that control the

Unknown 15:05
comments on folks. Yeah, you'll

Unknown 15:13
do like

Unknown 15:17
I say is too complicated.

Unknown 15:20
I think it's okay like I've never been like really connected to like girls like most of my friends are guys because. So, yeah, it's. I mean, I would like, go to this app, if I read have issues, but you know it's not on the top of my list. Yeah.

Unknown 15:39
Do you see this as you focus on woman or you can choose like a woman's version or men's version.

Unknown 15:50
I think men would probably like an app like that too. So I think there could be like two versions on this. Each one gender. Yeah.

Unknown 16:00
Okay, I really, really.

Unknown 16:15
So use.

Unknown 16:17
So you're saying like, what kind of hero or you just need to kind of

Unknown 16:22
like when they have like relationship problems. Yeah. And then when I have been found in my relationship,

Unknown 16:30
no relationship maybe like if you have pregnancy questions like since I see it on one of the topics. And also there's this like you need to hash tags and where like when people get like sexual assault. They go like go there or if they get raped or something. This could be a place to like just vented out and like have a free space to talk to.

Unknown 16:56
Charles. When will I use this out. Yeah probably if I have like really specific girl issue.

Unknown 17:04
Okay.

Unknown 17:09
Andre.

Unknown 17:12
So what's the hardest part about this job. Yeah.

Unknown 17:39
I don't think there's like a lot of stuff that's too hard. But then

Unknown 17:44
one issue is that if I want to find a post that I recently read or what and then I couldn't

Unknown 17:53
find it by like, like if there's a like a Google thing to like search that word. Yeah.

Unknown 18:01
So it's hard to go back to the topic I want to sit

Unknown 18:09
at all just

Unknown 18:12
do I do have a challenge.

Unknown 18:18
I think so yeah cuz throughout my life, I don't really have like very woman finger.

Unknown 18:26
And that's my mom,

Unknown 18:28
which I'm not very close to. So, yeah.

Unknown 18:41
Okay, I feel

Unknown 18:50
like

Unknown 18:53
people are trading

Unknown 19:00
alpha alpha woman are using the Euro such as

Unknown 19:05
something that is more related to your lifestyle.

Unknown 19:09
Yeah, I wouldn't yeah this app is not very suitable for me.

Unknown 19:15
Okay, so what do you think, how you gonna. How we gonna make me become a more suitable for you.

Unknown 19:29
But it's more like it says it doesn't fit me there there this app would probably fit a lot of others.

Unknown 19:37
Probably like

Unknown 19:39
fit a lot of other girls who are having performance issues.

Unknown 19:44
Right now I don't have so

Unknown 19:49
yeah and sauce,

Unknown 19:50
because I feel like.

Unknown 19:53
Since this is, like,

Unknown 19:55
it's mainly languages like mainly English, and I'm like an Asian. So, I probably will like apps that might be like that. but it's more like a Chinese version. Okay,

Unknown 20:08
so now I feel like connect more to like those people cuz you know like, oh yeah yeah different culture.

Unknown 20:14
Yeah, different ethnic people, they don't really think the same. Okay. Yeah,

Unknown 20:18
so, and there was a hill and the SAM he's kind of really coming back to section. Yes. My and, I think, like in Asian countries we don't talk about

Unknown 20:30
sex, often. So, so that's why I feel like this is more like a war for

Unknown 20:36
the western people. Okay, interesting.

Unknown 20:42
I feel like we should never be days. So I think that when you look at the top be actually in the top he is really connected to each other. He is like juice located. Yeah, which is can be like, one topic, and you can talk about a lot of things. Yeah, but

Unknown 21:02
I feel like it's useful like that because maybe one day you'll be like, Oh, you might think of like once very specific topic. And it just fits it. So, having more topics it's okay it's all nice they're like 10,000 topics,

Unknown 21:17
okay, because I feel I know, Ashley there are a lot of woman likes to talk about their name, then body shape. Yeah. And also my their style of our faith. Yeah, I know it's a skincare by when you look at the app. Actually, he didn't really sure about this kind of topic

Unknown 21:39
body.

Unknown 21:40
Yeah. But when you clean the body, most people will talk about all their near pregnancy.

Unknown 21:48
No, it's funny shape, way,

Unknown 21:53
way like woman doing sport or fitness something like that.

Unknown 21:58
How to be skinny. Yeah. How did this get a skincare.

Unknown 22:06
Oh, woman style. You mean there isn't skincare famosa like so bodies I want, what do you mean by body I the first

Unknown 22:15
impression would be like, how fit you are like people girls will be talking about losing weight.

Unknown 22:23
Yeah and like body shape, like,

Unknown 22:27
Yeah, I guess so this this kind of copies of the beat right so because body You can also related to like the size, which is already been

Unknown 22:39
mentioned about fear, but then it's like, if you're talking about body,

Unknown 22:44
sex is about the first thing you think of, right. So, I don't know, I

Unknown 22:47
think this topic is okay. Yeah, but

Unknown 22:51
five of us and I really into your

Unknown 22:54
lifestyle right Bobby it's like kind of one of the more related ones because I do care about my problems and stuff. But then it's like

Unknown 23:03
sex or pregnancy or like woman 50 plus

Unknown 23:06
product. They don't really relate to me.

Unknown 23:09
So probably, you will be better if you once you enroll app. And you can you can pull out your age. You can. You will show like we just said where I know where I'll be. Yeah, that would help.

Unknown 23:37
Okay,

Unknown 23:37
yeah, more traction,

Unknown 23:39
or design problem narrative that

Unknown 23:41
just figure out. Yeah, take the polar

Unknown 23:44
dz supposed to be in the beginning of our

Unknown 23:50
zbd then yeah I think before around the app, actually you can really find, like, you can ask, surely choose a color of the app.

Unknown 23:59
Yeah, having a like a pink background it's not really my favorite.

Unknown 24:02
And so are you looking at a brand new sign you saw this is my pregnancy right.

Unknown 24:08
I know it's hard to see, or it's about like a lesbian half.

Unknown 24:12
It doesn't like

Unknown 24:14
finding the name is

Unknown 24:15
for sister who so probably is a so

Unknown 24:17
okay so when you go to a topic.

Unknown 24:23
Where you fill your home button. Yeah, actually you can go back to the homepage.

Unknown 24:29
Yeah I know I noticed that the homeless here.

Unknown 24:33
By the way, so it's kind of

Unknown 24:37
nice. It's not

Unknown 24:41
some, a new like, like when I click on something. It's very easily. Becoming a heart that I'm supporting others know what I'm not so.

Unknown 24:57
So are you can you remain the app.

Unknown 25:00
Are you gonna make the Instagrams file for a sour you have a lot of change.

Unknown 25:08
I think though via a couple of changes Yeah, not really like Instagram so since it's not really Instagram ish. So, if it's like something that's similar to Instagram but not really the same then it would be confusing for users. Yeah. Do

Unknown 25:25
you have more passion or more design poplin for this.

Unknown 25:29
I think I'm good.

Unknown 25:31
And thank you for participating.
